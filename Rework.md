# Rework - Jason Fried

## Chapter: Takedowns

### Ignore the real world

**_That would never work in the real world.” You hear it all the time when you tell people about a fresh idea._**

"The real world isn’t a place, it’s an excuse. It’s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you."

### Failure is not a a rite of passage

**_Failure is not a prerequisite for success_**

“You need to learn from your mistakes. What do you really learn from mistakes? You might learn what not to do again, but how valuable is that? You still don’t know what you should do next.”

### Planning is guessing

**_Why don’t we just call plans what they really are: guesses_**

"Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses, and your strategic plans as strategic guesses. Now you can stop worrying about them as much"
