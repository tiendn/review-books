# Rework - Jason Fried

## Chapter: Takedowns

### Ignore the real world

**_That would never work in the real world.” You hear it all the time when you tell people about a fresh idea._**

The real world isn’t a place, it’s an excuse. It’s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.

### Failure is not a a rite of passage

**_Failure is not a prerequisite for success_**

You need to learn from your mistakes. What do you really learn from mistakes? You might learn what not to do again, but how valuable is that? You still don’t know what you should do next.

### Planning is guessing

**_Why don’t we just call plans what they really are: guesses_**

Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses, and your strategic plans as strategic guesses. Now you can stop worrying about them as much

### Grow

**_What’s wrong with finding the right size and staying there_**

Have you ever noticed that while small businesses wish they were bigger, big businesses dream about being more agile and flexible? And remember, once you get big, it’s really hard to shrink without firing people, damaging morale, and changing the entire way you do business.

Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. Anyone who runs a business that’s sustainable and profitable, whether it’s big or small, should be proud.

### Work

**_Workaholism_**

Not only is this workaholism unnecessary, it’s stupid. Working more doesn’t mean you care more or get more done. It just means you work more.

Workaholics wind up creating more problems than they solve

Workaholics aren’t heroes. They don’t save the day, they just use it up. The real hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get things done.

### Be a starter

**_Let’s retire the term entrepreneur. It’s outdated and loaded with baggage_**

Instead of entrepreneurs, let’s just call them starters. Anyone who creates a new business is a starter. You don’t need an MBA, a certificate, a fancy suit, a briefcase, or an above-average tolerance for risk. You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get started.

## Chapter: GO

### Make a dense in the universe

**_If you're going to do something, do something that matters_**

To do great work, you need to feel that you’re making a difference. That you’re putting a meaningful dent in the universe. That you’re part of something important.

It’s just that your efforts need to feel valuable. You want your customers to say, “This makes my life better.” You want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do, people would notice.

### Scratch your own itch

**_The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use. That lets you design what you know—and you’ll figure out immediately whether or not what you’re making is any good._**

These people scratched their own itch and exposed a huge market of people who needed exactly what they needed. That’s how you should do it too.

When you build what you need, you can also assess the quality of what you make quickly and directly, instead of by proxy.

### Start

**_Until you actually start making something, your brilliant idea is just that, an idea_**

We all have that one friend who says, “I had the idea for eBay. If only I had acted on it, I’d be a billionaire!” That logic is pathetic and delusional. Having the idea for eBay has nothing to do with actually creating eBay. What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.

Ideas are cheap and plentiful. The original pitch idea is such a small part of a business that it’s almost negligible. The real question is how well you execute.

### Execute notane

**_No time is no excuse_**

The most common excuse people give: “There’s not enough time". There’s always enough time if you spend it right.

### Draw a line in the sand

**_As you get going, keep in mind why you’re doing what you’re doing_**

Strong opinions aren’t free. You’ll turn some people off. They’ll accuse you of being arrogant and aloof. That’s life. For everyone who loves you, there will be others who hate you. If no one’s upset by what you’re saying, you’re probably not pushing hard enough.

We’re willing to lose some customers if it means that others love our products intensely.

### Live it or leave it

**_Standing for something isn’t just about writing it down. It’s about believing it and living it._**

There’s a world of difference between truly standing for something and having a mission statement that says you stand for something

### Plan Z

**_Outside money is Plan Z_**

Spending other people’s money may sound great, but there’s a noose attached. Here’s why:”

> **You give up control**. When you turn to outsiders for funding, you have to answer to them too. That’s fine at first, when everyone agrees. But what happens down the road? Are you starting your own business to take orders from someone else? Raise money and that’s what you’ll wind up doing.

> **“Cashing out” begins to trump building a quality business.** Investors want their money back—and quickly (usually three to five years). Long-term sustainability goes out the window when those involved only want to cash out as soon as they can.

> **Spending other people’s money is addictive.** There’s nothing easier than spending other people’s money. But then you run out and need to go back for more. And every time you go back, they take more of your company.

> **It’s usually a bad deal.** When you’re just beginning, you have no leverage. That’s a terrible time to enter into any financial transaction.

> **Customers move down the totem pole.** You wind up building what investors want instead of what customers want.

> **Raising money is incredibly distracting.** Seeking funding is difficult and draining. It takes months of pitch meetings, legal maneuvering, contracts, etc. That’s an enormous distraction when you should really be focused on building something great.

Before you stick your head in that noose, look for another way.

### Do you really need?

**_You need less than you think_**

Do you really need ten people or will two or three do for now?

Do you really need $500,000 or is $50,000 (or \$5,000) enough for now?

Do you really need six months or can you make something in two?

Do you really need a big office or can you share office space (or work from home) for a while?

Do you really need to buy advertising and hire a PR firm or are there other ways to get noticed?

Do you really need to build a factory or can you hire someone else to manufacture your products?

Do you really need an accountant or can you use Quicken and do it yourself?

Do you really need an IT department or can you outsource it?

Do you really need a full-time support person or can you handle inquiries on your own?

Do you really need to open a retail store or can you sell your product online?

Do you really need fancy business cards, letterhead, and brochures or can you forego that stuff?

> You get the point. Maybe eventually you’ll need to go the bigger, more expensive route, but not right now.

> You get the point. Maybe eventually you’ll need to go the bigger, more expensive route, but not right now.

### Startup

**_Start a business, not a startup_**

The start up is a magical place. It’s a place where expenses are someone else’s problem. It’s a place where that pesky thing called revenue is never an issue. It’s a place where you can spend other people’s money until you figure out a way to make your own. It’s a place where the laws of business physics don’t apply.

The problem with this magical place is it’s a fairy tale. The truth is every business, new or old, is governed by the same set of market forces and economic rules. Revenue in, expenses out. Turn a profit or wind up gone.

A business without a path to profit isn’t a business, it’s a hobby.

So don’t use the idea of a startup as a crutch. Instead, start an actual business.

Actual businesses have to deal with actual things like bills and payroll. Actual businesses worry about profit from day one. Actual businesses don’t mask deep problems by saying, “It’s OK, we’re a startup.” Act like an actual business and you’ll have a much better shot at succeeding.”

### You need a commitment strategy not an exit strategy

Another thing you hear a lot: “What’s your exit strategy?” You hear it even when you’re just beginning. What is it with people who can’t even start building something without knowing how they’re going to leave it? What’s the hurry? Your priorities are out of whack if you’re thinking about getting out before you even dive in.

You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. You should be thinking about how to make your project grow and succeed, not how you’re going to jump ship. If your whole strategy is based on leaving, chances are you won’t get far in the first place.

### Lease - Long term contracts - Inventory - Meetings

**_Embrace the idea of having less mass. Right now, you’re the smallest, the leanest, and the fastest you’ll ever be_**

-   Long-term contracts
-   Excess staff
-   Permanent decisions
-   Meetings
-   Thick process
-   Inventory (physical or mental)
-   Hardware, software, and technology lock-ins
-   Long-term road maps
-   Office politics

Avoid these things whenever you can. That way, you’ll be able to change direction easily. The more expensive it is to make a change, the less likely you are to make it.

Huge organizations can take years to pivot. They talk instead of act. They meet instead of do. But if you keep your mass low, you can quickly change anything: your entire business model, product, feature set, and/or marketing message. You can make mistakes and fix them quickly. You can change your priorities, product mix, or focus. And most important, you can change your mind.

## Chapter Progress

### Less is the good thing

**_Embrace constraints_**

I don’t have enough time/money/people/experience.” Stop whining. Less is a good thing. Constraints are advantages in disguise. Limited resources force you to make do with what you’ve got. There’s no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative.

So before you sing the “not enough” blues, see how far you can get with what you have

### You're better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole

**_Build half a product, not a half-assed product_**

You can turn a bunch of great ideas into a crappy product real fast by trying to do them all at once. You just can’t do everything you want to do and do it well. You have limited time, resources, ability, and focus. It’s hard enough to do one thing right. Trying to do ten things well at the same time? Forget about it.

### Start

**_Start at the epicenter_**

When you start anything new, there are forces pulling you in a variety of directions. There’s the stuff you could do, the stuff you want to do, and the stuff you have to do. The stuff you have to do is where you should begin. Start at the epicenter.

The way to find the epicenter is to ask yourself this question: “If I took this away, would what I’m selling still exist?

### Basics

**_Ignore the details early on_**

Architects don’t worry about which tiles go in the shower or which brand of dishwasher to install in the kitchen until after the floor plan is finalized. They know it’s better to decide these details later.

You need to approach your idea the same way. Details make the difference. But getting infatuated with details too early leads to disagreement, meetings, and delays. You get lost in things that don’t really matter. You waste time on decisions that are going to change anyway. So ignore the details—for a while. Nail the basics first and worry about the specifics later.

### Decisions are progress

**_Making the call is making progress_**

Don’t wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward.


### Creation

**_Be a curator_**

...

### ...

**_Throw less at the problem_**

Do less. Your project won’t suffer nearly as much as you fear. In fact, there’s a good chance it’ll end up even better. You’ll be forced to make tough calls and sort out what truly matters.


### Focus on what won't change

**_Focus on what won't change_**

A lot of companies focus on the next big thing. They latch on to what’s hot and new. They follow the latest trends and technology.

That’s a fool’s path.”


The core of your business should be built around things that won’t change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now. Those are the things you should invest in.

Remember, fashion fades away. When you focus on permanent features, you’re in bed with things that never go out of style.


### Gear doesn't matter

**_Tone is in your fingers_**

In business, too many people obsess over tools, software tricks, scaling issues, fancy office space, lavish furniture, and other frivolities instead of what really matters. And what really matters is how to actually get customers and make money.

You also see it in people who want to blog, podcast, or shoot videos for their business but get hung up on which tools to use. The content is what matters. You can spend tons on fancy equipment, but if you’ve got nothing to say … well, you’ve got nothing to say.

Use whatever you’ve got already or can afford cheaply. Then go. It’s not the gear that matters. It’s playing what you’ve got as well as you can. Your tone is in your fingers.

### You can't make just one thing.

**_Sell your by-products_**

When you make something, you always make something else. You can’t make just one thing. Everything has a by-product. Observant and creative business minds spot these by-products and see opportunities.
