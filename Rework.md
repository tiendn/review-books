# Rework - Jason Fried

## Chapter: Takedowns

### Ignore the real world

**_That would never work in the real world.” You hear it all the time when you tell people about a fresh idea._**

The real world isn’t a place, it’s an excuse. It’s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.

### Failure is not a a rite of passage

**_Failure is not a prerequisite for success_**

You need to learn from your mistakes. What do you really learn from mistakes? You might learn what not to do again, but how valuable is that? You still don’t know what you should do next.

### Planning is guessing

**_Why don’t we just call plans what they really are: guesses_**

Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses, and your strategic plans as strategic guesses. Now you can stop worrying about them as much

### Grow

**_What’s wrong with finding the right size and staying there_**

Have you ever noticed that while small businesses wish they were bigger, big businesses dream about being more agile and flexible? And remember, once you get big, it’s really hard to shrink without firing people, damaging morale, and changing the entire way you do business.

Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. Anyone who runs a business that’s sustainable and profitable, whether it’s big or small, should be proud.

### Work

**_Workaholism_**

Not only is this workaholism unnecessary, it’s stupid. Working more doesn’t mean you care more or get more done. It just means you work more.

Workaholics wind up creating more problems than they solve

Workaholics aren’t heroes. They don’t save the day, they just use it up. The real hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get things done.

### Be a starter

**_Let’s retire the term entrepreneur. It’s outdated and loaded with baggage_**

Instead of entrepreneurs, let’s just call them starters. Anyone who creates a new business is a starter. You don’t need an MBA, a certificate, a fancy suit, a briefcase, or an above-average tolerance for risk. You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get started.
